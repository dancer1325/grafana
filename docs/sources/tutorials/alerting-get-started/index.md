            # works | container, BUT NOT -- via -- Grafana
            ```
            ```dockercompose.yml
            - "GF_UNIFIED_ALERTING_DISABLED_LABELS=false"

          * Solution: ‚≠êÔ∏èOPTIONAL web settings, Disable certificate verification‚≠êÔ∏è
  * | [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/),
    * there's a `POST /` entry

## Create an alert

* [alert rule](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/alerting-rules/create-grafana-managed-rule/)

* steps
  1. Navigate to **Alerts & IRM > Alerting > Alert rules**
  2. **New alert rule**
  3. Enter alert rule name

### Define query and alert condition

* goal
  * Grafana-managed alert rule creation's default options 
    * == query + threshold expression (`WHEN` field)

* Grafana's [test data source](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/testdata/)
  * üëÄcreates simulated time series dataüëÄ

* steps
  1. Select the **TestData**
  1. In the **Alert condition** section:
     - _Scenario_ == **Random Walk** 
     - Alert condition (== threshold condition), `Last` `IS ABOVE 0`
  1. Click **Preview alert rule condition** to run the query
     * 's return
       * random time series data
       * 's state == `Firing`

### Add folders and labels

1. | **Folder**, **+ New folder**, enter a name

  ![](static/test-metrics.png)

### Set evaluation behavior

* [alert rule evaluation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/fundamentals/alert-rules/rule-evaluation/)
  * defines the conditions under which an alert rule triggers, based on the following settings:

- **Evaluation group**: every alert rule is assigned to an evaluation group. You can assign the alert rule to an existing evaluation group or create a new one.
- **Evaluation interval**: determines how frequently the alert rule is checked. For instance, the evaluation may occur every 10s, 30s, 1m, 10m, etc.
- **Pending period**: how long the condition must be met to trigger the alert rule.
- **Keep firing for**: defines how long an alert should remain in the Firing state after the alert condition stops being true. During this time, the alert enters a _Recovering_ state, suppressing additional notifications but keeping the alert active. It helps prevent alert flapping, where alerts rapidly switch between firing and resolved due to noisy or unstable metrics.

To set up the evaluation:

1. In the **Evaluation group and interval**, enter a name. For example: `1m-evaluation`.
1. Choose an **Evaluation interval** (how often the alert are evaluated).
   For example, every `1m` (1 minute).
1. Set the **pending period** to, `0s` (zero seconds), so the alert rule fires the moment the condition is met.
1. Set **Keep firing for** to, `0s`, so the alert stops firing immediately after the condition is no longer true. Use this when you want alerts to be resolved as soon as the system is healthy again.

### Configure notifications

Choose the contact point where you want to receive your alert notifications.

1. Under **Contact point**, select **Webhook** from the drop-down menu.
1. Click **Save rule and exit** at the top right corner.

<!-- INTERACTIVE page step4.md START -->

## Trigger and resolve an alert

Now that the alert rule has been configured, you should receive alert [notifications](http://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/alerting/fundamentals/alert-rule-evaluation/state-and-health/#notifications) in the contact point whenever alerts trigger and get resolved.

### Trigger an alert

Since the alert rule that you have created has been configured to always fire, once the evaluation interval has concluded, you should receive an alert notification in the Webhook endpoint.

{{< figure src="/media/docs/alerting/alerting-webhook-firing-alert.png" max-width="1200px" caption="Firing alert notification details" >}}

The alert notification details show that the alert rule state is Firing , and it includes the value that made the rule trigger by exceeding the threshold of the alert rule condition. The notification also includes links to see the alert rule details, and another link to add a [Silence](http://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/alerting/configure-notifications/create-silence/) to it.

### Resolve an alert

To see how a resolved alert notification looks like, you can modify the current alert rule threshold.

To edit the Alert rule:

1. **Navigate to Alerting** > **Alert rules**.
1. Click on the metric-alerts folder to display the alert that you created earlier
1. Click the **edit** button on the right hand side of the screen
1. Increment the Threshold expression to 1.
1. Click **Save rule and exit**.

By incrementing the threshold, the condition is no longer met, and after the evaluation interval has concluded (1 minute approx.), you should receive an alert notification with status **‚ÄúResolved‚Äù**.
