# Configure recording rules

* Recording rules
  * allows
    * pre-compute queries + save the results -- as -- NEW time series metrics 
      * NEW time series metrics uses
        * OTHER alert rules
        * OTHER dashboard queries
  * use cases
    * **Faster queries**
    * **Reduce system load:**
      - Reason:ðŸ§ Precompute specific queries in advancðŸ§ 
    * **Simplifying complex aggregations:**
      - Reason:ðŸ§ use NEW metricðŸ§ 
    * **Reusing queries across alerts:**
      - Improve efficiency by reusing the same query across similar alert rules and dashboards
  * types of recording rules
    1. [Grafana-managed recording rules](ref:grafana-managed-recording-rules)
       * ALLOWED | any Grafana data source -- supported by -- alerting
       * recommended
    2. [Data source-managed recording rules](ref:data-source-managed-recording-rules)
       * requirements
         * Prometheus-based data sources (Mimir, Loki or Prometheus)
