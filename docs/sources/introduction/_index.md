# About Grafana
* Grafana open source (OSS)
  * enables you,
    * about metrics + logs + traces,
      * query,
      * visualize,
      * alert on,
      * explore
    * connect OTHER data sources 
      * _Example:_ NoSQL/SQL databases
    * ticketing tools
      * _Example:_ Jira or ServiceNow 
  * provides
    * tools /
      * your time-series database (TSDB) data are turned -- into -- insightful graphs & visualizations

* see 
  * [installed Grafana](../setup-grafana/installation)
  * [playlist](../dashboards/create-manage-playlists)
  * if you are the admin for an enterprise & manage Grafana | MULTIPLE teams,
    * [provisioning](../administration/provisioning)
    * [authentication](../setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication)
  * [Grafana Community forums](https://community.grafana.com/)

## Explore metrics, logs, and traces

* Explore your data
  * -- through -- 
    * ad-hoc queries
    * dynamic drilldown
  * if you want to split view & compare different time ranges, queries and data sources -> see [Explore](../explore)

## Alerts

* alert notifiers
  * built-in PagerDuty, SMS, email, VictorOps, OpsGenie, or Slack

* Alert hooks
  * allow you to
    * create DIFFERENT notifiers -- via -- low-code

## Annotations

* == annotate graphs -- with -- ðŸ‘€DIFFERENT data sources' rich eventsðŸ‘€
  * == correlate data

* == graph marker | Grafana
* ways to create
  * manually | pannel
  * query annotations

* [Annotations](../dashboards/build-dashboards/annotate-visualizations/)

## Dashboard variables

* [Template variables](../dashboards/variables/)
  * allow you to 
    * create dashboards / can be reused
    * drill down | your data

## Configure Grafana

* see
  * [Grafana configuration options](../setup-grafana/configure-grafana/)
  * [Grafana CLI](../cli/)

* == config files + environment variables
  * _Examples:_ default ports, logging levels, email IP addresses, security, ...

## Import dashboards and plugins

* [dashboards](/grafana/dashboards)
* [plugins](https://grafana.com/docs/plugins/)

## Authentication

* supported authentication methods
  * LDAP
  * OAuth

* see [User authentication overview](../setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/)

* | Grafana
  * OSS
    * users are mapped -- to -- organizations
  * [Enterprise](grafana-enterprise.md)
    * users are mapped -- to -- organizations & teams
    * teams are mapped -- to -- teams

## Provisioning

* allows
  * configure Grafana AUTOMATICALLY
    * == -- via -- script
* uses
  * create MANY dashboards

* [MORE](../administration/provisioning/)

## Permissions

* use case
  * organizations / have 1 Grafana & MULTIPLE teams /
    * keep things separate
    * share dashboards

* | [Grafana Enterprise](grafana-enterprise),
  * create a team of users / set permissions | 
    * [folders & dashboards](../administration/user-management/manage-dashboard-permissions/)
