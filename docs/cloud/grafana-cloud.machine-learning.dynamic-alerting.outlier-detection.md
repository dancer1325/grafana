* goal
  * create an Outlier Detector
  * set up outlier-based alerts 

* Grafana AIâ€™s outlier detection
  * allows
    * ðŸ‘€identify some group's members behavior != rest members behaviorðŸ‘€ 
      * == forecast anomalies
  * requirements
    * Grafana cloud
    * Editor permissions
    * \>= 3 series
  * _Example of uses:_
    * how the load is distributed ACROSS Grafana Mimir ingester
  * 's algorithm
    * 's inputs
      * sensitivity -- to -- your liking
        * higher sensitivity -> MORE outliers & alerts fired 
    * built-in algorithms
      * DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise)
        * == cluster data points -- based on -- their density 
          * updated CONTINUOUSLY
        * use cases
          * series move in sync | time
          * strong trends | your data 
      * MAD (Median Absolute Deviation)
        * 's inputs
          * sensitivity threshold
        * compares
          * data points | EACH timestamp vs rolling 24-hour median 
        * use cases
          * ALL group's members move | stable band of normal behavior / NO affected by out-of-sync events
  * ðŸ‘€| save it -> NEW metric is exposed | Prometheus's `grafanacloud-ml-metrics`ðŸ‘€
    * `<outlier_detector_metric_name>:outliers`
      * 's return
        * binary
          * 0 == NO outlier
          * 1 == outlier

* Outlier Detector query
  * == series / are compared + baseline group

## how to create
### outlier detection
* AI & machine learning > Outlier detection > add query
### outlier-based alert
* requirements
  * outlier detection
* AI & machine learning > Outlier detection > add alert

# _Examples:_
## | save it -> NEW metric is exposed | Prometheus's `grafanacloud-ml-metrics`

## how to create outlier detection?
* Grafana cloud
  * Problems:
    * Problem1: "Not enough series: Outlier detection requires 3 or more series to work."
      * Solution: TODO:
* [Grafana sandbox](https://play.grafana.org/a/grafana-ml-app/outlier-detector)
## how to create outlier-based alert?
* Grafana cloud
  * Problems:
    * Problem1: NOT outlier detection saved
